# TrainTime

This application is hosted on Github Pages and can be found at: https://ironam1.github.io/TrainTime/

This application demonstrates knowledge of Firebase. User will be displayed train arrivals with real time data. User can add their own train schedule and the arrival time will be calculated upon entry into database.

I attempted to create a firebase sign in with github authentication but was unsuccessful.
