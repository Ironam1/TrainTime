# TrainTime

This application is hosted on Github Pages and can be found at: https://ironam1.github.io/TrainTime/

The problem:

Create an application that uses Firebase to host and modify a database, then return the data to the user.

Solution:

I created an application that calculates the arrivals time for trains. When the application loads, user will be shown real-time ETA for trains already in the database. User can add their own trains and schedule with the provided form.

I had attempted to write in an authentication, but was unsuccessful. The buttons are inoperable.
